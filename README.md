## <a name="quick-start">🤸 Quick Start</a>

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v16.0.0 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v7.0.0 or later)

**Cloning the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chief-myk/Mayank-portfolio.git
cd Mayank-portfolio
```

**Installation**

Install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

**Set Up Environment Variables**

Create a new file named `.env` in the root of your project and add the following content:

```env
VITE_APP_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
VITE_APP_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id
VITE_APP_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual **[EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/)** credentials.

**Running the Project**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/) in your browser to view the project.

**Building for Production**

```bash
npm run build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
